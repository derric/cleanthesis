## About

**Clean, Simple, Elegant**
*Clean Thesis* is a LaTeX style for thesis documents. The style can be understood as my personal compromise â€” a typical clean looking scientific document combined and polished with minor beautifications. The design of this *Clean Thesis* style is inspired by user guide documents from Apple Inc.

## Getting started

* Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* Install the [Remote-Container extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VSCode.
* Download this repo and open the respective folder in VSCode. Select the 'Reopen in Container option'.
