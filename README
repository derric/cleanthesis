*** Clean, Simple, Elegant ***
"Clean Thesis" is a LaTeX style for thesis documents, developed
for my diplom thesis (Diplomarbeit). The style can be understood
as my personal compromise â€” a typical clean looking scientific
document combined and polished with minor beautifications.

The design of this "Clean Thesis" style is inspired
by user guide documents from Apple Inc.

Note: If you are looking for an exact and correct style regarding
typographic rules, please have a look at the "Classic Thesis Style"
(see http://www.miede.de/index.php?page=classicthesis).

*** Donation = Postcard ***
Based on the idea of Andr\'e Miede: If you like the "Clean Thesis"
style I would be very pleased about a donation in the form of a
POSTCARD. You can find my address at http://cleanthesis.der-ric.de/
as well as in the file Clean-Thesis.pdf. I am going to collect all
postcards and exhibit them at the website I mentioned.

*** Idea and Inspiration ***
The idea of providing my customized style for thesis documents
passed through my mind while writing my own thesis. Motivated and
inspired by the superb "Classic Thesis Style"
(see http://www.miede.de/index.php?page=classicthesis) by Andr\'e Miede
(thanks to Andr\'e for doing a great job) I decided to collect all
design and style related functionality in a separate LaTeX style and
provide this style to other thesis writers.
